# fms-scheduler
This project focuses on real-time systems with a mixed-criticality nature, containing tasks of high criticality (e.g., collision avoidance) and low criticality (e.g., cabin temperature control). While improper execution of high-criticality tasks leads to critical failures, low-criticality tasks impact only the quality of service without significant risk.
